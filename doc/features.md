- structurally compare different values of the same type
- provides a recursive structural breakdown of differences between product types
- provides a diff (using Myers' algorithm) between sequence types with different elements
- presents results as an immutable datatype which can be rendered as a tabular tree of differences
- diff sequences can be customized for more meaningful output
